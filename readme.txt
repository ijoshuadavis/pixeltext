# PixelText is a content visualization concept to translate each unique word from 
# the targeted text (e.g. books, lyrics, poems) to a color (specified or random)
# and then display the word as a pixel in order as they appeared in the original
# text. Simply put, translate these words to pixels. The hope is to create novel
# and compelling art from sources that already possess meaning as well as possibly
# provide a new perspective on the text.
